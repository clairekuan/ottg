# Edith has heard about a cool new online to-do app.
# She goes to check out its homepage.
browser = webdriver.Firefox() #she opens Firefox
browser.get('http://localhost:8000') #go to the homepage

# She notices the page title and header mention to-do lists.
assert 'To-Do' in browser.title

# She is invited to enter a to-do item straight away

# She types "Buy peacock feathers" into a text box
# (Edith's hobby is tying fly-fishing lures)

# When she hits enter, the page updates, and now the page lists
# "1. Buy peacock feather" as an item in a to-do lists

# There is still a text box inviting her to add another item
# She enters 'Use peacock feathers to make fly'
# (Edith is very methodological)

# The homepage updates again, and now shows both its items on her lists

# Edith wonders whether the site will remember her lists.  Then she sees
# that the site has generated a unique URL for her -- there is some
# explanatory text to that effect.

# She visits the URL - her to-do lists is still there.

# Satisfied, she goes back to sleep.
